# DevOps + SRE Daily Challenge! 🎉

Welcome to my **DevOps + SRE Daily Challenge** repository! This project captures my journey as I dive deep into the world of **DevOps** and **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**. It contains all the daily challenges, exercises, and solutions I’ve worked on, starting from the basics and progressing towards complex automation, cloud infrastructure, and deployment pipelines.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This repository is a learning log and practice space where I:

- Follow daily challenges to reinforce my knowledge.
- Learn and implement tools, techniques, and best practices used in **DevOps** and **SRE**.
- Work on automating infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and everything in between.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools Used

Here’s a list of the tools and technologies I’ve been using in this journey:

- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (EC2, VPC, IAM, S3, Lambda, etc.)
- **Automation**: Terraform, Ansible
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLab CI
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Scripting**: Bash, Python
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## 📜 Structure

The repo is structured to reflect the daily learning and challenges I work on. It contains:

- **Day-wise folders**: Each folder represents a day in my journey.
- **Code/Configurations**: Contains all scripts, configuration files, and code implementations for each challenge.
- **Documentation**: Describes key concepts and solutions I implement for each challenge.
- **Project Logs**: A daily log of what I’ve learned, what went well, and challenges faced.

## 📚 Learning Goals

The main goal of this repository is to:

- Strengthen my understanding of **DevOps** principles and practices.
- Implement **Site Reliability Engineering** concepts to ensure application uptime and reliability.
- Learn to build, deploy, and monitor applications using modern DevOps tools.
- Automate workflows and make everything **Infrastructure as Code**.

## 💡 Key Concepts

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** & **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Automation & Configuration Management**
- **Cloud Infrastructure Management**
- **Containerization & Orchestration**
- **Monitoring & Observability**
- **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** practices

## 🏆 Daily Challenges

Each day, I’ll try to:

1. **Learn a new concept**.
2. **Practice** it using real-world scenarios.
3. **Automate** common tasks.
4. **Deploy** and **monitor** services.
5. **Iterate** based on learnings and challenges.
